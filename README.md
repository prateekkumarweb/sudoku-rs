# Sodoku Solver in Rust

This is a simple sodoku solver written in Rust. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the sodoku puzzle.

The program reads the input file and parses the sodoku puzzle. It then uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. The program prints the solved puzzle to the console.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can run the program by executing the following command:
